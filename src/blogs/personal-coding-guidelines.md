# My coding guidelines

## The code itself

Code should be **simple.** If it does too much, split it up. Don’t just add code, ask yourself if it’s **simple**, **flat**, **consistent** and **self explanatory**. If not, **change it!** To **simplify**, use **describing names**, and keep the code flat. This way the code is going to **tell a story**.

## The coding mentality

Always **enhance** the code you are working on. The fact that you wrote it a while ago, or somebody else wrote it, **doesn’t** mean you can’t improve it. Apply the **boyscout rule** a.k.a. **improve**! Code should be **as simple as possible**. Never **complicate** but **simplify**.

Start by learning the **basics** and you will end up loving them. By truly understanding the basics, you can more easily start **learning** new things. Because everything is build upon those basics.
