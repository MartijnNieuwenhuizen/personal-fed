# My personal development mission

My main goal is to **help** people. This should always be done by **adding value**. The solution should be clearer than the previous solution. Never complicate but **simplify.** If something is not clear, **ask why,** no matter who you are talking to. And never accept the answer **"That's just how we do it"**.

With that, only build things you **yourself** truly believe in have **lotâ€™s of fun** while doing this!
