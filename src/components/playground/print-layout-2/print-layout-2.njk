        A red stone, placed on a grey laptop and overlaid with a grey filter. All to mimic the image above but don't copy it. The store is found at the beach after a hard storm. The red color is incredible, a pity that you don't see it. Af course this text is also just here to mimic the text above. The contents doesn't have any value at all! As long as the image above becomes a responsive version to show you the possibilities on the web.
